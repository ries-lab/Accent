The Micro-Manager 2 plugin allows acquiring and processing the images to calibrate the camera. The Fiji plugin only allows the calibration from already acquired images. In addition, we provide a Micro-Manager 1.4 script to perfom the acquisitions.

Note that the Micro-manager 2 plugin is based on ImageJ1 and should provide superior speed to the Fiji plugin. However, the Fiji plugin should be compatible with TIFF acquired with other softwares than Micro-Manager, while there is no guarantee images acquired with other softwares can be loaded in Micro-manager 2.
